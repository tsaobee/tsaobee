# Hi, I'm tsaobee 👋

**Tutor • Content Creator • Explorer**

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm an English and Social Studies (history & geography) tutor and content creator who loves turning ideas into reality and learning something new every day. While I’m just starting with code, I’m endlessly curious about all kinds of AI tools and how they can enhance the way we learn, teach, and create.

## 🌟 What I Do
- Teach and create engaging content about English, history, and geography
- Learn from everyone and everything around me
- Experiment with and explore AI tools to make learning and creativity even better

## ✈️ Interests
- Anything beautiful—from art to landscapes to moments
- Traveling and discovering new cultures and places
- Connecting with people who love to learn and share

## 💡 Always Learning
I may not be a coder (yet!), but I’m passionate about making the most of technology. If you have tips or want to share your experiences with AI tools, I’m always eager to learn from you!

Let’s learn, grow, and make ideas real—together!
